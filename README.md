# OneStop Search API

The API provides three Search endpoints for search and discovery of data. The following are some examples of well-formatted queries for interacting with the OneStop `/onestop/api/search/collection`, `/onestop/api/search/granule`, and `/onestop/api/search/flattened-granule` (version 2.1+) resource endpoints. Note that either a POST or GET request with a correctly formatted JSON request body will work.

All three endpoints expect the same request schema format to be used but return data of the type in the URL.  

* Endpoints
  - [Collection](api/collection.md)
  - [Granule](api/granule.md)
  - [Flattened Granules](api/flattened.md)
